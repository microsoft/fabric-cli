When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## Contribution process
To avoid cases where submitted PRs are rejected, please follow the following steps:
- To report a new issue, follow [Create an issue](#creating-an-issue)
- To work on existing issue, follow [Find an issue to work on](#finding-an-issue-to-work-on)
- To contribute code, follow [Pull request process](#pull-request-process)

### Creating an issue

Before reporting a new bug or suggesting a feature, please search the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cli/issues) to check if one already exists.

All reported bugs or feature suggestions must start with creating an issue in the GitHub Issues pane. Please add as much information as possible to help us with triage and understanding. Once the issue is triaged, labels will be added to indicate its status (e.g., "need more info", "help wanted").

When creating an issue please select the relevant topic - bug, new feature or general question - and provide all required input.

We aim to respond to new issues promptly, but response times may vary depending on workload and priority.

### Finding an issue to work on

#### For Beginners
If you're new to contributing, look for issues with these labels:
- **`good-first-issue`** - Beginner-friendly tasks that are well-scoped and documented
- **`help wanted`** - Issues where community contributions are especially welcome
- **`documentation`** - Improve docs, examples, or help text (great for first contributions)

#### Getting Started Tips
1. **Start small** - Look for typo fixes, documentation improvements, or simple bug fixes
2. **Read existing code** - Familiarize yourself with the codebase by exploring similar commands
3. **Ask questions** - Comment on issues to clarify requirements or get guidance
4. **Test locally** - Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting

#### Before You Code
All PRs must be linked with a "help wanted" issue. To avoid rework after investing effort:
1. **Comment on the issue** - Express interest and describe your planned approach
2. **Wait for acknowledgment** - Get team confirmation before starting significant work
3. **Ask for clarification** - Don't hesitate to ask questions about requirements

Please review [engineering guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cli/wiki) for coding guidelines and common flows to help you with your task. 

### Pull request process

Please use a descriptive title and provide a clear summary of your changes.

All pull requests (PRs) should be linked to an approved issue, please start the PR description with `- Resolves #issue-number`

Before submitting the pull request please verify that:
- The PR is focused on the related task
- Tests coverage is kept and all tests pass
- Your code is aligned with the code conventions of this project

Before your PR can be merged, make sure to address and resolve all review comments. PR will be labeled as "need author feedback" when there are comments to resolve. Approved PRs will be merged by the Fabric CLI team.

### Documenting Changes with Changie

All pull requests must include proper change documentation using [changie](https://changie.dev), which is pre-installed in the development container. This ensures that release notes are automatically generated and changes are properly tracked.

#### Requirements

**Every PR must include at least one change entry** created using `changie new`. You may add multiple entries if your PR introduces multiple distinct changes.

#### How to Add Change Entries

1. **From the Terminal, run `changie new` command**:
   ```bash
   changie new
   ```

2. **Select the appropriate change type** from the available options:
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Change** - For changes that break backward compatibility
   - **üÜï New Items Support** - For adding support for new Fabric item types
   - **‚ú® New Functionality** - For new features, commands, or capabilities
   - **üîß Bug Fix** - For fixing existing issues or incorrect behavior
   - **‚ö° Additional Optimizations** - For performance improvements or optimizations
   - **üìù Documentation Update** - For documentation improvements or updates

3. **Provide a clear description** of your change:
   - Write in present tense (e.g., "Add support for..." not "Added support for...")
   - Be specific and user-focused
   - Include the affected command or feature if applicable
   - Keep it concise but informative

#### Examples of Good Change Descriptions

- `Add new 'fab describe capacity' command for viewing capacity details`
- `Fix authentication timeout issue in interactive mode`
- `Update workspace examples with new folder hierarchy patterns`
- `Optimize API response caching to reduce network calls`

#### Guidelines

- **One logical change per entry**: If your PR fixes a bug and adds a feature, create two separate entries
- **User-facing perspective**: Describe what users will experience, not internal implementation details
- **Clear and actionable**: Users should understand what changed and how it affects them
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow the examples and existing patterns in the changelog

The change entries will be automatically included in the release notes when a new version is published. This process ensures that all improvements, fixes, and new features are properly communicated to users.
